Wednesday 4am_.

We don't manage to get the third beer in time, I'm glad, I'm beginning to feel rather bloated, and yes I could go a hamburger and chips, if only there was somewhere that sold them. There is still this guy who lives just around the corner. It is four o'clock in the morning, I can't see him welcoming us with open arms.

Thursday 9:30am_.

The alarm goes off, I think I am not going to survive the day. I wonder if I will meet any of the guys from last night again, mostly I want to speak to K again. I am not sure if I would recognise any of the others anyway.
