Wednesday 4am_.

We don't manage to get the third beer in time, I'm glad, I'm beginning to feel rather bloated, and yes I could go a hamburger and chips, if only there was somewhere that sold them. There is still this guy who lives just around the corner. It is four o'clock in the morning, I can't see him welcoming us with open arms.

Thursday 9:30am_.

The alarm goes off, I think I am not going to survive the day. I wonder if I will meet any of the guys from last night again, mostly I want to speak to K again. I am not sure if I would recognise any of the others anyway.

Friday 12:30am_.

I decide that I will go down to the bar again. On the way I drop into another bar to see if there is any one I know there. Perhaps K may be there as well. I run into a group of new friends I have made during the last couple of nights and sit down for a drink. I forget all about the night before and I think I just subconsciously assume that I will not see my new friend again.
