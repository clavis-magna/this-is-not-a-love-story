Wednesday 3:40am_.

It is the end of the night, or beginning of the morning and I am still out in what would appear to be a really trashy bar. Conversation seems to be based around girls and fast cars, I'm not sure which would make some of these guys happier. For some reason I feel fine, I'm in a new place meeting new people and it seems that I have been accepted into a circle of male bonding. There is also a lot of talk of what we will drink next, and where it will come from. Perhaps we will head to this other guys place, he may be home, but probably wont be awake, but it doesn't matter because he has a bottle of whisky. There is a realisation that the bar is actually open for another twenty minutes and that if we are quick we could probably get at least 3 more beers down in that time. I know that I don't want three more beers, so I drink the one that has just been bought for me very slowly. The guys can see through this ploy and hurry me along, anyway its my turn to buy, so I have to drink up and get to that bar. The bar is now closing in only ten minutes. They will be flashing the lights soon. 

There is one guy amongst this group who seems more interested in chatting than the others, he wants to know more, about me and also about where I come from and what I do. His name is K and I seem to get along with him without any need for defence barriers. Perhaps it is just because I am very drunk, and so is he.

Wednesday 4am_.

We don't manage to get the third beer in time, I'm glad, I'm beginning to feel rather bloated, and yes I could go a hamburger and chips, if only there was somewhere that sold them. There is still this guy who lives just around the corner. It is four o'clock in the morning, I can't see him welcoming us with open arms.

It's really time to go home, I say I'm leaving, which does not go down that well, but I am determined, and disappear back to my room, and sound asleep within minutes of lying down. I think nothing more about K that evening.

*

Thursday 9:30am_.

The alarm goes off, I think I am not going to survive the day. I wonder if I will meet any of the guys from last night again, mostly I want to speak to K again. I am not sure if I would recognise any of the others anyway.

*

Friday 12:30am_.

I decide that I will go down to the bar again. On the way I drop into another bar to see if there is any one I know there. Perhaps K may be there as well. I run into a group of new friends I have made during the last couple of nights and sit down for a drink. I forget all about the night before and I think I just subconsciously assume that I will not see my new friend again.

*

Friday 4:30am_.

I have been out drinking all night again and head home for a quick sleep before I have to be up at 9am again.

*

Second Thursday 2am_.

Over the last week my ritual has been the same. Up early to work and in bed late after long nites out. I think my body is getting used to it now. The bar I am in has just closed and there is word that we are all going off to another bar. We all leave, I am with a large group tonight, and head down the road. The bar we are going to is actually a night club, of the sort that I would not normally find myself at. But anyway, it is probably the liveliest place in town tonight, and we manage to get a bit of dancing in before 4am when it closes. On the way out I hear my name called and realise it is K. He is sitting at the entrance, very drunk and very happy. The group I have come with disperse very quickly and I am left chatting with him. The familiar question of where can we go next comes up, and I remember I have a quarter full bottle of rum back in my room - He needs no persuasion and we head off.

*

Second Thursday 5am_.

We have been sitting around in a common room drinking my rum and chatting with some other people who are there. K is being extremely friendly to the point of flirting, which surprises me. He invites me outside for a cigarette, and puts his arm around me as he lights it. After a quick smoke we go back inside and he sits extremely close to me and sort of wraps himself around me. Then he says "so here we are then." followed by a suggestive pause, and a look that can only come with that sort of statement. I don't know what to do, and just try to work out the situation. K is extremely ambiguous as to his intentions, and  I, although quit drunk, feel incapable of being forward. He grabs my hand and says "lets go." and we leave the room.

*

Second Thursday 5:20am_.

We are on a sports field and K has just told me that his soul is mine.
We sit on one of the large bags for pole vaulting onto, and again the statement "so here we are" and "I once ran naked around this field. I feel like doing something really silly." 

*

Second Thursday 8am_.

K is writing down his phone number for me and jumping in a taxi to go home. The last two hours have been filled with simple, suggestive conversion, but always very ambiguous, to me anyway, and as I have said I have been very standoffish. I walk home and go to bed. I will ring him in the morning.

*

Second Friday 4pm_.

I don't see the morning. I try the phone number K has given me and it is not connected. I wonder if he gave me a wrong number on purpose. I begin to wonder where I should be to be most likely to run into K. Or who to ask who may have his number. I think I am becoming obsessive about meeting him again.

*

Second Saturday 2pm_.

I have found someone who knows K and get his phone number. I ring him and actually get him out of bed. he sounds a little surprised that I have rung, but perhaps he is just sleepy. We plan to meet at a bar tonight. 

*

Second Sunday 3am_.

Tonight is following a very similar course to last nights. K had originally been very quiet and seemed a little embarrassed about the other night. "I must have been very drunk. I'm not sure I can remember everything that happened," I know he knew exactly what had happened, as he became drunken his memory seemed to come back to him, quite clearly in fact. The bars are almost all closing again. and word is that it might be a good night for a swim. We head down for the river, K has removed all of his clothes before we even get close to the bank. It is the second time in one week that I have seen him naked, I think he likes showing off, he is playing a game of sorts with me. I am quite drunk, I must be, this is not a game I usually play!

*

Second Sunday 7am_.

K and I have spent the night together again. Wandering the streets in and out of peoples houses and other groups wandering. We even watched someone's home video. I say goodbye, I am extremely tired. There is much hugging and even dare I say it some form of intimacy and we both go our own ways. I get a feeling however that I should not ring him tomorrow, or even the next day. I am sure if K had spoken what he would have said was "you will see me when you see me, goodbye".

*

Third Thursday 11pm_.

I have just arrived at the bar and K is here. I go over and say hi, he asks me how I am going, fine, I say I will come back and chat later, I need to speak to some other people first.

*

Third Friday 2am_.

The bar has closed, I have not returned to K's table, I think maybe he left sometime earlier. I don't know I was not paying attention. I was too busy in another conversation.

*

Fourth Friday 10pm_.

I have seen K only once in the last week. I was on the street during the day, and he walked by. We waved at each other and that was all. I wonder what he was thinking.

This Is Not A Love Story.
